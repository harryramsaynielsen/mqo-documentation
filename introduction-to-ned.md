# 2. General Overview
Giving a general overview of various topics for the purpose of broad understanding.


## 2.1. “NEd 101”: A Beginner’s Guide
### 2.1.1. Introduction / Main Areas
NEd is the primary tool used for editing video data within Gracenote. Broadly speaking, it encompasses four main areas:

| Programs | People | Schedules | Mappings |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |

These function in slightly different ways.

- **Programs**
    - This stores information about the assets themselves (movies, episodes, series, etc.) For example, information about a movie would include all of the different versions that it has (English, Italian, director’s cut, etc), its genre, its release date, and so on.
    - Images are also stored here.
    - This is accessed within SQL by using `programs.program`.
- **People**
    - Stores information about people, which can include actors and actresses, characters, cast, and crew.
- **Schedules**
    - fsgsdfg
- **Mappings**


### 2.1.2. Programs

### 2.1.3. Types and subtypes
Within the Video department, we have different categories of data, which are referred to as Types. These can primarily be categorised as the following:

- Movies
- Series
- Episodes
- Sports

Within each of these categories, there are further Subtypes. For instance, Movies could be subtyped as one of the following:

- Feature Film
- Short Movie
- TV Movie




Different types (Movies, Series etc)
Different image types
Different IDs: program IDs, how they relate to TMS IDs, etc
Program structure (what fields are used by Content and which are commonly requested)
Remote metadata vs TMS data (Mapping scheme)
Link between programs and schedule data 
Common Content dictionary (what they talk about when they talk about ‘mapping scheme’?) 
Typical reports (OVD, Linear, VOD),  metadata + image, different templates
